Recommend not reviewing this until you have attempted all of the labs.

The commands shown in the "solutions" are `kubectl` commands, but
corresponding `k9s` commands could be used instead.

# LAB1

## Deployment 1

In this deployment, there is a typo in the image for the container name
used for the deployment. 

To see this mistake, run `kubectl describe pod -n debugging <pod-name>`

You will see an error similar to:

```
  Warning  Failed     2m56s (x5 over 5m51s)  kubelet            spec.containers{pause}: Failed to pull image "registry.kBs.io/pause:3.9": failed to pull and unpack image "registry.kBs.io/pause:3.9": failed to resolve reference "registry.kBs.io/pause:3.9": failed to do request: Head "https://registry.kBs.io/v2/pause/manifests/3.9": remote error: tls: unrecognized name
```

Note that there is an image pull error. Look closely at the image and recognize
there is likely a typo `Failed to pull image "registry.kBs.io/pause:3.9"`

Edit the deployment1.yaml file to have the image name of
`registry.k8s.io/pause:3.9` replacing the *B* with an *8*.
Wait for the deployment to restart the pod, and watch it pull successfully.

Remember that you can reapply releases with `kubectl apply -f <deploy_file>`

## Deployment 2

In this deployment, the image is in a private registry that cannot be pulled
from in the current setup. To get around this, private images can be accessed
by setting a secret and adding a specific reference to it to your deployment.

You can see the failed image pull by running a describe
`kubectl describe pod -n debugging <pod-name>`

You will see an error similar to:

```
  Warning  Failed     12m (x5 over 14m)     kubelet            spec.containers{app}: Failed to pull image "ghcr.io/jsmith-clarityinnovates/python:1.0.0": failed to pull and unpack image "ghcr.io/jsmith-clarityinnovates/python:1.0.0": failed to resolve reference "ghcr.io/jsmith-clarityinnovates/python:1.0.0": failed to authorize: failed to fetch anonymous token: unexpected status from GET request to https://ghcr.io/token?scope=repository%3Ajsmith-clarityinnovates%2Fpython%3Apull&service=ghcr.io: 401 Unauthorized
```

Note the failure for a `401 Unauthorized` reason.

You can then check the deployment2.yaml file to see if the required secret
config is present. Open the file and look for a block like

```
  imagePullSecrets:
  - name: <secret_name>
```

You'll notice that no such configuration is present. You can then see if
there is a secret present already that might have the required auth in it.

`kubectl get secrets -n debugging`
`kubectl describe secret -n debugging private-registry-creds` or
`kubectl edit secret -n debugging private-registry-creds`

You find that there does appear to be a valid secret, so you can attempt
to update the deployment to use it. 

Add this to the deployment file. Update it from

```
        app: deployment2
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: app
          image: ghcr.io/jsmith-clarityinnovates/python:1.0.0
```

to

```
        app: deployment2
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: app
          image: ghcr.io/jsmith-clarityinnovates/python:1.0.0
      imagePullSecrets:
        - name: private-registry-cred
```

After doing this, you'll notice that the deployment is still failing for a 401.

This is usually indicative that the creds you're using are incorrect, and
you would have to reach out to the owner of the repository or the person that
gave you the credentials for updated credentials.

## Deployment 3

Deployment three is rather unique in that if you start just by looking for
pods, you'll not see deployment three.

`kubectl get pods -n debugging`

```
NAME                                  READY   STATUS             RESTARTS         AGE
deployment1-5c958c5b79-pxq4s          1/1     Running            0                16m
deployment2-6495bcf979-7p8fk          0/1     ImagePullBackOff   0                27m

...
```

To gather information about what is going wrong here, walk through the
describing deployment and then replicaset.

`kubectl describe deployment -n debugging deployment3`

```
  ReplicaFailure   True    FailedCreate
  Progressing      False   ProgressDeadlineExceeded

```

Note, not major errors in the Event log for the deployment.

`kubectl describe replicaset -n debugging deployment3-######`

Note the errors in the event log.

```
Events:

require-guard-for-policy-target:
  require-guard-label: 'validation error: guard: training is required. rule require-guard-label
    failed at path /metadata/labels/guard/'
```

This suggests to take a look at the Kyverno policies.

`kubectl get kyverno -A`

Shows all kyverno policies; you will see one clusterpolicy that is applied to
this cluster. You can gain more information by describing this policy.

`kubectl describe clusterpolicies  require-guard-for-policy-target`

See the rule at the top.

```
  Rules:
    Match:
      Any:
        Resources:
          Kinds:
            Pod
    Name:  require-guard-label
    Preconditions:
      All:
        Key:                   {{ request.object.metadata.labels.training || '' }}
        Operator:              Equals
        Value:                 policy-target
    Skip Background Requests:  true
    Validate:
      Allow Existing Violations:  true
      Message:                    guard: training is required
      Pattern:
        Metadata:
          Labels:
            Guard:            training
```

This requires that there be a label called `guard: training` against any pod
that has the label `training=policy-target`.

From describing the pod earlier, we can see that this deployment would deploy
pods with that label.

```
RollingUpdateStrategy:  25% max unavailable, 25% max surge
Pod Template:
  Labels:  app=deployment3
           training=policy-target
  Containers:
```

To fix, update the deployment file to add the appropriate label.

```
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: deployment3
        training: policy-target
        guard: training
    spec:
```

And reapply it to your cluster.

# LAB2

## Deployment 4

In this deployment, the pod appears to be in a CrashLoopBackOff, as
recommended, you should start with just a describe and see if there's anything
interesting there.

`kubectl describe pod -n debugging <pod>`

Unfortunately, nothing shows up from the describe that is overly useful.

```
  Type     Reason   Age                    From     Message
  ----     ------   ----                   ----     -------
  Normal   Pulled   4m10s (x243 over 20h)  kubelet  spec.containers{app}: Container image "debugging/distro-python:1.0.0" already present on machine and can be accessed by the pod
  Normal   Created  4m10s (x243 over 20h)  kubelet  spec.containers{app}: Container created
  Warning  BackOff  4m9s (x1047 over 20h)  kubelet  spec.containers{app}: Back-off restarting failed container app in pod deployment4-77d498bf4f-jdr27_debugging(dea3e6cd-66b8-47aa-ac23-3f828824095b)
```

Next, you should likely run logs against the pod

`kubectl logs -n debugging deployment4-77d498bf4f-jdr27`

Revealing

```
Defaulting to default logging, to increase logging, set LOG_LEVEL to DEBUG
LOG_LEVEL: None
```

Seeing this, the logs suggest adding an environment variable for "LOG_LEVEL"
and set it to DEBUG. To do that, edit the deployment and add the following.

```
    spec:
      volumes:
      containers:
        - name: app
          image: debugging/distro-python:1.0.0
          imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
          env:
            - name: LOG_LEVEL
              value: DEBUG
```

After adding the environment variable, rechecking the logs shows the following.

```
LOG_LEVEL: DEBUG
Missing or inccorect value for required variable REQUIRED_ENV. Set it to "true".
```

Seeing this, the logs suggest adding an environment variable called
"REQUIRED_ENV" and setting it to "true". Do this similar to the above,
after doing this, the pod runs successfully.

## Deployment 5

Similar to deployment 4, this deployment is in a CrashLoopBackOff. Describing
the deployment does not reveal anything useful.

Looking at the logs for the pod, so the following:

```
During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 5, in <module>
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.11/urllib/request.py", line 216, in urlopen

    raise URLError(err)
urllib.error.URLError: <urlopen error [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: unable to get local issuer certificate (_ssl.c:1016)>
```

We can see a cert error here, if we describe the deployment we can get
a better idea of what it is trying to talk to.

```
    Command:
      python
      -c
      import time
      import urllib.request

      while True:
        with urllib.request.urlopen(
            "https://service5.debugging.svc.cluster.local",
            timeout=5,
        ) as response:
            print(response.read().decode())

        time.sleep(8)

    Environment:
```

Here we can see it is trying to connect to services5 in the debugging
namespace. If we describe the service5 deployment, we can see it is using
a secret, service5-tls, mounted into the pod to act as its certificate.

```
    Command:
      python
      -c
      import http.server
      import ssl

      class Handler(http.server.BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
          def do_GET(self):
              self.send_response(200)
              self.end_headers()
              self.wfile.write(b"ok\n")

      httpd = http.server.ThreadingHTTPServer(("0.0.0.0", 8443), Handler)
      context = ssl.SSLContext(ssl.PROTOCOL_TLS_SERVER)
      context.load_cert_chain("/tls/tls.crt", "/tls/tls.key")
      httpd.socket = context.wrap_socket(httpd.socket, server_side=True)
      httpd.serve_forever()

    Environment:  <none>
    Mounts:
      /tls from tls (ro)
  Volumes:
   tls:
    Type:          Secret (a volume populated by a Secret)
    SecretName:    service5-tls
    Optional:      false
```

If we grab the secrets, we can see a deployment5-ca, which we can guess
may be the CA that signed this certificate. If you don't want to make this
assumption, you could use openssl to verify this.

To add this CA to deployment5, it is a secret, so we can mount that secret
in as a file. To do that, edit your deployment5.yaml file.

```
...
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt
          name: ca-bundle
          readOnly: true
          subPath: ca-certificates.crt
...
      volumes:
      - name: ca-bundle
        secret:
          defaultMode: 292
          secretName: deployment5-ca
...
```

You must add a volume under "volumes" matching the secret, and then mount
that volume into the container. Note, that because I mounted into an existing
directory and I just want to mount a specific file, it's important to use
"subPath", which will result in the "ca-certificates.crt" value from the
secret being placed at the file "/etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt"

After the CA is inside the container, you need to have your software use it,
to do this, update the python to add the SSL context.

```
          command:
            - python
            - -c
            - |
              import time
              import urllib.request

              ctx = ssl.create_default_context(cafile="/etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt")

              while True:
                with urllib.request.urlopen(
                    "https://service5.debugging.svc.cluster.local",
                    timeout=5,
                    context=ctx,
                ) as response:
                    print(response.read().decode())

                time.sleep(8)
```

After that, the deployment will restart and you should start seeing "ok" in the
logs.

## Deployment 6

Unlike deployment 4 and 5, this pod appears to be running successfully, or at
least, it has the "Running" status. Describing the pod does not reveal anything
interesting, however, the logs for the pod shows.

```
Writing logs to /var/log
Error in appliation, exiting
```

This log suggest the application is likely not running correctly. If this were
a web application, it would be good to check the web UI; but this is not, so
we will just have to trust the logs. The logs suggest reading a log in
/var/log.

To view the file system of the container, exec into the container.

`kubectl exec -it -n debugging <pod> -- /bin/bash`

Upon doing so, we see the following files in /var/log/

```
root@deployment6-5884bb9dc5-7cxbp:/app# cd /var/log
root@deployment6-5884bb9dc5-7cxbp:/var/log# ls
alternatives.log  apt  btmp  dpkg.log  lastlog  log.txt  wtmp
```

For those familiar with linux, you probably notice a stand out "log.txt" file.

cat'ing that file shows the following

```
root@deployment6-5884bb9dc5-7cxbp:/var/log# cat log.txt
Missing or incorrect value for required variable REQUIRED_ENV2. Set it to "true".
```

Similar to Lab 4, this suggested a missing env variable REQUIRED_ENV2.
Upon doing that, the pod stays in a Running status, now with no errors in the
log output.
